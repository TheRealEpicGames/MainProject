## About The Real Epic Games
Hello! We're The Real Epic Games. The Real One. Any others claiming to be under the name Epic Games are imposters and should be reported to the nearest authority. A few points of interest:
- We're a group of 6 Computer Science Majors at the University of Utah- Thomas Ady, Tyler Trombley, Tom Nguyen, Garrett Moseke, Colton Lee, and Michael Ratajczyk
- Colton and Tyler began the group, quickly expanding to include Tom and Thomas. Garrett and Thomas had previously worked together at the University, and were invited to join along with Garrett's roomate Michael.
- The idea for Fortnite 2 came about when discussing the Worms games and the idea of requiring players to actually phyiscally aim their weapons in VR, and the idea took off from there.
