Fortnite 2 is  multiplayer turn-based battle royale artillery game to build alliances and burn bridges heavily inspired by the Worms game franchise. Players take turns repositioning themselves before choosing a weapon and attempting to damage their friends. Gameplay continues until only one player remains standing and is declared the winner. We have full networked support for the game, with a simple direct connection host-client architecture that allows players to quickly join lobbies and begin playing. The use of VR means that players need to physically perform these actions: Aiming a pistol or tossing a grenade become much more difficult and interesting to do when you arenâ€™t presented with an exact telegraph of your actions.

Fortnite 2 will be released on December 9th, 2020 by The Real Epic Games based out of Salt Lake City for HTC Vive, HTC Index, and Oculus Rift.

## About The Real Epic Games
Hello! We're The Real Epic Games. The Real One. Any others claiming to be under the name Epic Games are imposters and should be reported to the nearest authority. A few points of interest:
- We're a group of 6 Computer Science Majors at the University of Utah- Thomas Ady, Tyler Trombley, Tom Nguyen, Garrett Moseke, Colton Lee, and Michael Ratajczyk
- Colton and Tyler began the group, quickly expanding to include Tom and Thomas. Garrett and Thomas had previously worked together at the University, and were invited to join along with Michael.
- The idea for Fortnite 2 came about when discussing the Worms games and the idea of requiring players to actually phyiscally aim their weapons in VR, and the idea took off from there.
